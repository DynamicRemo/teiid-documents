= Security Migration From Previous Versions

It is recommended that customers who have utilized the internal JDBC membership domain from releases prior to MetaMatrix 5.5 migrate those users and groups to an LDAP compliant directory server.

Refer to the JBoss Application Server security documentation for using an LDAP directory server. If there are additional questions or the need for guidance in the migration process, please contact technical support.

Several free and open source directory servers include:

* The Fedora Directory Server - http://directory.fedoraproject.org/[http://directory.fedoraproject.org/]
* Open LDAP - http://www.openldap.org/[http://www.openldap.org/]
* Apache Directory Server - http://directory.apache.org/[http://directory.apache.org/]
