Log File and Recorded Script file
---------------------------------

During the interactive mode, input is recorded in a history file. This file can be accessed via the up arrow in the interactive shell.

User can also capture the commands entered during a interactive session to their own script file by using "startRecording" and "stopRecording" commands. For example,

----
record start directory/filename.txt
<commands and script ..>
record stop
----

All input and output between the start and stop are captured in the "directory/filename.txt" file. This gives the user an option to capture only certain portions of the interactive session and to later refine a script out of recorded file.
