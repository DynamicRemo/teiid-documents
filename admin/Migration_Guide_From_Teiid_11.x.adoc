= Migration Guide From Teiid 11.x to 12.x

Teiid strives to maintain consistency between all versions, but when necessary breaking configuration and VDB/sql changes are made - and then typically only for major releases. 

You should consult the release notes for compatibility and configuration changes from each minor version that you are upgrading over.  This guide expands upon the release notes included in the kit to cover changes since 11.x.

If possible you should make your migration to Teiid 12 by first using Teiid 11.2.x.  Teiid 12 requires Java 8 and WildFly 14.  See also link:Migration_Guide_From_Teiid_10.x.adoc[10 to 11 Migration Guide]

== Configuration Changes

The default for org.teiid.longRanks changed to true.  This is more inline with other platforms.  You may switch it back to false for compatibility or make appropriate updates to your views and other sql that may expect integer values to be returned.

The configuration property names for the buffer manager have been refined to greater consistency.

|===

This change introduced a new version of the WildFly xml configuraiton for Teiid.  Older xml and cli are still compatible and are automatically converted to the new configuration.  You should not mix the usage of new and old properties.

== Compatibility Changes

The ability to specify a jgroups configuration file directly to Teiid Embedded has been removed.
If you need Teiid Embedded to support clustering, please log an issue.

== Kitting/Build Changes

The AdminShell has been removed from the build.  AdminShell has releases between 10.x and 11.x are effectively identical.  You may still use one of those versions if you wish to continue using AdminShell.  Alternatively you may use the AdminAPI directly from Java or with the scripting language binding of your choice.

Dependencies on JEE have been pushed to non-core modules of Teiid.  This should not affect anyone using a base Teiid distribution.  However if you have done custom development it may affect you.  The changes include:

* The `org.teiid.resource.spi` package was moved from the teiid-api jar to the org.teiid:teiid-resource-spi jar.  Poms will need to be updated accordingly.  There is no change needed for jboss modules as the teiid-resource-spi artifact is already included in org.jboss.teiid.api.

* ResourceException has been replaced by TranslatorException on Teiid connection interfaces such as SalesforceConnection.

* The file translator resource adapter translator and connector logic were refactored to use a Teiid VirtualFile interface rather than directly expose both a Java File and VFS.  If you were developing based upon FileConnection, please use VirtualFileConnection org.teiid.connectors:file-api instead.

* `org.teiid.translator.WSConnection` has been moved into org.teiid.connector:translator-ws `org.teiid.translator.ws.WSConnection`

* The arche-type version compatible with Teiid 12.0.0 has been bumped to 12.0.0.
