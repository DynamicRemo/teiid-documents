= Coherence Data Sources

Coherence data sources use a Teiid specific JCA connector that is deployed into Wildfly 10.0 during installation. This connector can be configured to support running Coherence within the same VM as Teiid or as a remote cache.

The following are the configuration properties that can be configured for this connector:

|===
|Property Name |Req. |Description

|CacheName
|Y
|Name of the Coherence Cache to read and write to

|CacheClassName
|Y
|Name of the Class stored in the Coherence Cache

|PrimaryKeyFieldName
|Y
|The name of the attribute that identifies the primary key to the Cache

|PrimaryKeyFieldClassName
|N
|[Optional]The primary key class name that identifies how the key is stored in the cache, if different than the object type of the primary key field
|===

There are many ways to create the data source, using CLI, link:AdminShell.adoc[AdminShell], admin-console etc. The example shown below uses the CLI tool, as this works in both Standalone and Domain modes.

Execute following command using https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Admin+Guide#AdminGuide-RunningtheCLI[CLI] once you connected to the Server. Make sure you provide the correct directory name and other properties below. Add any additional properties required by the connector by duplicating the "connection-definitions" command below. Edit the JNDI name to match the JNDI name you used in VDB. This script can be found in the https://github.com/teiid/teiid-coherence/blob/master/connector-coherence/kits/jboss-as7/docs/teiid/datasources/coherence/create-coherence-ds.cli[github repository].

TIP: *Developerâ€™s Tip* - If Wildfly 10.0 is running in standalone mode, you can also manually edit the "<jboss-install>/standalone/configuration/standalone-teiid.xml" file and add the XML configuration. An example of what can be copy and pasted can be found in the https://github.com/teiid/teiid-coherence/blob/master/connector-coherence/kits/jboss-as7/docs/teiid/datasources/coherence/coherence-ds.xml[github
repository]. Shutdown the server before you edit this file, and restart after the modifications are done.
