= Interactive Shell Nuances

The interactive shell uses a special shell interpretter and therefore has different behavior than just writting a script in Groovy. See the http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Shell[Groovy Shell Documentation] for more on its usage. Notable differences:

* Def statements do not define a variable in the context of the Shell, e.g. do not use `def x = 1`, use `x = 1`
* Shell commands (as seen through `help`) using the non-functional shell syntax are only available in the shell.
* Groovy classes using annotations cannot be parsed in the Shell.
