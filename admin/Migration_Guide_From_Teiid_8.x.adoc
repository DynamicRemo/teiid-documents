= Migration Guide From Teiid 8.x

Teiid strives to maintain consistency between all versions, but when necessary breaking configuration and VDB/sql changes are made - and then typically only for major releases. This guide expands upon the release notes included in the kit to cover changes since 8.x.

If possible you should make your migration to Teiid 9 by first using Teiid 8.13.  8.13 is a non-feature transitional release that is effectively Teiid 8.12 running on WildFly 9.0.2.  See also https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/teiid813final/Migration+Guide+From+Teiid+8.12[8.13 Migration Guide]

== JRE Support

WildFly 9+ is expected to use Java 1.7 or later. Both the server kit and usage of Teiid Embedded will require Java 1.7+. The client driver may still use a 1.6 runtime.

== Configuration Changes

You will need to apply your Teiid and other configuration changes starting with a new base configuration for WildFly, such as the standalone-teiid.xml included in the kit.  Note that 9999 port has been removed by default.  Admin connections are expected to use either 9990 (http) or 9993 (https).

=== Security Related

There is now a single session service. Session service related properties, prefixed by authentication, are no longer specified per transport. Instead they now appear as a single sibling to the transports.

  </transport>
----

The default maximum number of sessions was increased to 10000 to accommodate for this change.

In addition there is a new property trust-all-local that defaults to true and allows unauthenticated access by local pass-through connections over the embedded transport - this was effectively the default behavior of 8.x and before when no security-domain was set on the embedded transport. You may choose to disallow that type of access by setting the property to false in stead.

=== Local Transport

The embedded transport was renamed to local to avoid confusion with Teiid embedded.

=== Behavioral

==== widenComparisonToString

The resolverâ€™s default behavior was to widen comparisons to string, but 9.0 now defaults org.teiid.widenComparisonToString to false. For example with this setting as false a comparison such as "timestamp_col < 'a'" will produce an exception whereas when set to true it would effectively evaluate "cast(timestamp_col as string) < 'a'". If you experience resolving errors when a vdb is deployed you should update the vdb if possible before reverting to the old resolving behavior.

== Kitting/Build Changes

=== Embedded Kit

The Embedded Kit has been removed.  You should follow the https://github.com/teiid/teiid-embedded-examples[Embedded Examples] to use maven to pull the dependencies you need for your project.

There were extensive changes in dependency management for how the project is built.  These changes allowed us to remove the need for resource adapter jars built with the lib classifier.  If you need to reference these artifacts from maven, just omit the classifier.

=== Legacy Drivers

The drivers for JRE 1.4/1.5 systems have been discontinued. If you still need a client for those platforms, you should use the appropriate 8.x driver.
