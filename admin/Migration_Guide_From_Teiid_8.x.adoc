= Migration Guide From Teiid 8.x

Teiid strives to maintain consistency between all versions, but when necessary breaking configuration and VDB/sql changes are made - and then typically only for major releases. This guide expands upon the release notes included in the kit to cover changes since 8.x.

== Configuration Changes

=== Security Related

There is now a single session service. Session service related properties, prefixed by authentication, are no longer specified per transport. Instead they now appear as a single sibling to the transports.

[source,xml]
.*Old standalone.xml Configuration*
----
  <transport name="local"/>
  <transport name="odata">
    <authentication security-domain="teiid-security"/>
  </transport>
  <transport name="jdbc" protocol="teiid" socket-binding="teiid-jdbc">
    <authentication security-domain="teiid-security"/>
  </transport>
  <transport name="odbc" protocol="pg" socket-binding="teiid-odbc">
    <authentication security-domain="teiid-security"/>
    <ssl mode="disabled"/>
  </transport>

[source,xml]
.*New standalone.xml Configuration*
----
  <authentication security-domain="teiid-security"/>

  <transport name="local"/>
  <transport name="odata"/>
  <transport name="jdbc" protocol="teiid" socket-binding="teiid-jdbc"/>
  <transport name="odbc" protocol="pg" socket-binding="teiid-odbc">
    <ssl mode="disabled"/>
  </transport>
----

The default maximum number of sessions was increased to 10000 to accommodate for this change.

In addition there is a new property trust-all-local that defaults to true and allows unauthenticated access by local pass-through connections over the embedded transport - this was effectively the default behavior of 8.x and before when no security-domain was set on the embedded transport. You may choose to disallow that type of access by setting the property to false in stead.

=== Local Transport

The embedded transport was renamed to local to avoid confusion with Teiid embedded.

=== Behavioral

==== widenComparisonToString

The resolverâ€™s default behavior was to widen comparisons to string, but 9.0 now defaults org.teiid.widenComparisonToString to false. For example with this setting as false a comparison such as "timestamp_col < 'a'" will produce an exception whereas when set to true it would effectively evaluate "cast(timestamp_col as string) < 'a'". If you experience resolving errors when a vdb is deployed you should update the vdb if possible before reverting to the old resolving behavior.

== Kitting Changes

=== Legacy Drivers

The drivers for JRE 1.4/1.5 systems have been discontinued. If you still need a client for those platforms, you should use the appropriate 8.x driver.
