Security functions provide the ability to interact with the security system.

== HASROLE

Whether the current caller has the Teiid data role roleName.

[source,sql]
----
hasRole([roleType,] roleName)
----

_roleName_ must be a string, the return type is boolean.

The two argument form is provided for backwards compatibility. roleType is a string and must be `data'.

Role names are case-sensitive and only match Teiid link:Data_Roles.adoc[Data Roles]. JAAS roles/groups names are not valid for this function - unless there is corresponding data role with the same name.
