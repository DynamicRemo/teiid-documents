= System Schema

The built-in SYS and SYSADMIN schemas provide metadata tables and procedures against the current VDB.

== Metadata Visibility

The SYSTEM schema tables and procedures are always visible/accessible.

When link:Data_Roles.adoc[Data Roles] are in use table/views, columns, and procedure metadata entries will not be visible if the 
user is not entitled to use the object.  Tables/views/columns require the READ permission and procedures require the EXECUTE permission.
