= XML SELECT Command

NOTE:XML Documents Models are deprecated.  You should use SQL/XML functions or OData access to form complex documents instead.

Complex XML documents can be dynamically constructed by Teiid using XML Document Models. A document model is generally created from a schema. The document model is bound to relevant SQL statements through mapping classes. See the Designer guide for more on creating document models.

XML documents may also created via XQuery with the link:XML_Functions.adoc#_xmlquery[XMLQuery] function or with various other link:XML_Functions.adoc[SQL/XML] functions.

Querying XML documents is similar to querying relational tables. An idiomatic SQL variant with special scalar functions gives control over which parts of a given document to return.
