* **Designer Plugin** - Eclipse Plugin based Teiid Design time, used to connect/federate/transform datasources in design time, the result will produce a `.vdb` file.
* **JVM** - Teiid is pure java Data Virtualization Platform, it run on JVM.
* **JBoss/WildFly** - Teiid use a plugable installation which need a JBoss/WildFly Server installed, alternatively, a full installed JBoss/Wildfly kit be distributed.
* **Subsystem** - Due to JBoos/WildFly's Modular and Pluggable Architecture(a series of Management commands compose of a subsystem, a series of subsystems compose of the whole server), Teiid implement WildFly's Controller/Management API developed a `teiid` subsystem and reuse lots of other subsystems like `resource-adapter`, `infinispan`, `security`, `logging`, `datasource`.
* **odata.war** - Teiid support OData via odata.war, more details refer to link:../client-dev/OData_Support.adoc[OData Support] 
* **dashboard.war** - A dashboard for generating analytical diagram
* **teiid-console** - A web based administrative and monitoring tool for Teiid, more details refer to link:../admin/Teiid_Console.adoc[Teiid Console]
* **JDBC Driver** - JDBC Driver to connect to Teiid Server
* **adminshell** - A scripting based Monitor/Management Tools, more details refer to link:../admin/AdminShell.adoc[AdminShell]
* **quickstarts** - A quickstart use to quick start Teiid.

== Teiid Architecture

* **Client** - link:../client-dev/Client_Developers_Guide.adoc[Client Develop Guide]
* **Transport** - The Transport mainly management the client connection, security authentication, encryption, etc.
* **Query Engine** - Query Engine can be separate to 2 parts: Request Process and Source Query. Request Process mainly contains the following aspects functionality

1. SQL to Processor Plan convert, once query engine receives an incoming SQL, it first be `Parsing` to a internal command, the command be convert to a logical plan via `Resolving`, `Validating`, `Rewriting`, then rule-based Optimization convert logical plan to a final Processor plan. More details refer to link:Federated_Planning.adoc[Federated Planning].
2. Batch Collect, asyn Query the Source, Compile results once the asyn futureTask has return.
3. Buffer Management, which controls the bulk of the and off heap memory that Teiid is using, prevents consuming too much memory that exceed the vm size.
4. Transaction Manager.

Source Query mainly contains 2 layer, Data Tier layer interact with Query Processor, Connector layer connect to Translator/Resource Adapter.
 
* **Connector** - Teiid has developed a series of Translators, more details refer to link:Translators.adoc[Translators]. Each Translator reference with a Resource Adapter, more details refer to link:../dev/Developing_JEE_Connectors.adoc[Developing JEE Connectors].
* **Data** - Data including multiple, heterogeneous data stores, like Databases/Data warehouse, NoSQL, Hadoop, Data Grid/Cache, File, SaaS, etc.
